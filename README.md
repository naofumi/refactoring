# Summary

This repository provides executable code of the examples provided in
"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler, et. al.

The folders inside `src/main/java/com/example` are named by page number in the book, and the name of the refactoring technique being introduced. Inside each folder, you can find some Java classes. You can execute any of the classes with a `main` method.

The examples represent the code before refactoring.

# Learning Refactoring

1. Run the code as is to get and idea of how it works.
2. Refactor according to the book.
3. Re-run the code to see if it works.

I also strongly recommend that, in addition to refactoring the code, you should read the "Motivation" paragraphs. These sections are succinct, but are full of valuable information. It's worth trying to understand each sentence and each phrase. Nothing should be glossed over. There's a lot of wisdom in every single word.
